# Word cloud Visualization

Make dull textual data points jump off the page, helping users immediately grasp what is significant in a text source. Word Cloud visualizations do this by using font size and color to make important words appear bigger and bolder. The text source can be data such as metadata tags on a web site or any free form text.

Word cloud visualizations can be a powerful business tool. For example, they can help identify new SEO terms to target on a web site or they can visualize customer or employee feedback to help find pain points. Multiple word clouds let you easily see the similarities and differences between diverse text sources at a glance.

For performance reasons, the visualization first sorts the text data based on the selected metric and then chooses the top 250 words to visualize.  This D3 Word Cloud visualization is a good dashboard alternative to the out-of-the-box MicroStrategy Data Cloud widget.
